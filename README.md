# Showtimegram

# Project showtimegram 

The Goal:
For this homework we are having you build out a mini Instagram called showtimegram.

The goals for the homework are the following:
The ability for a person to load a page with an “add an image button” that will show them (ajax) or take them to a page with a form that has a button to upload an image, put a username and a caption on that image.

Upon posting that form, it will store the necessary data in an sqlite database and upload the image to a directory (relative - > /images)

When the home page is reloaded, the image will be shown with the username and caption on it

Bonus:

The user can delete an image that was posted. (any image since we aren’t using auth)

We’re attaching a ui here for what the home page could look like. It does not need to match perfectly, this is just a guide.

Here the image is 600px wide max with an 30px username and 18px caption. There is a 20px padded container with a semi transparent background.
These are just rough guides.

Expected tech stack:
* PHP (any framework is fine, just make sure either a composer file or the dependencies are included)
* SQLite
* Any HTML/JS/CSS included

Zip up the files and send them named following (yourname).fullstackhomework.zip (or gzip). If the file is too large to email, please put it in a dropbox or shared file space and email the link.

If the app requires any build processes (running composer/npm install/etc) please include those directions in your email.
